# Reverse engineering - challenge 1
You need to find the flag in the form of: {artist name - song name}.
The complete challenge file is under the directory: the_challenge.
If you want you can only practice the executable file which is under the directory: setup_files.

# setup_file
* challenge.c - The challenge program itself.
* hetText.c - Helper program to convert sentences in ASCII-string format to Hex-string format.
* hexTextOutput.txt - Contains the sentences used in the challenge.c file.
* Hashes.txt - Contains MD5 hashes of passwords used in the challenge.c file.
* Reverse-Memes.jpg - Picture for the challenge.
* challenge.exe - The compiled challenge executable file.

# Compiling the challenge
1. Make sure gcc installed.
2. Open command prompt.
3. Type: <code>gcc -o challenge.exe challenge.c</code>
4. Type: <code>copy /b challenge.exe + Reverse-Memes.jpg Challenge.jpg</code>
4. Have fun!

# Detailed solution
<br>1. Open the <code>.jpg</code> file in Hex-Editor.
<br>2. Search for <code>PK..</code>, magic-number for <code>.zip</code> files.

<br>3. Change the file extension to <code>.zip</code> and open the archive.
<br>4. Extract the challenge.exe file.
<br>5. Open command-prompt and try some password.

<br>6. Open the executable file in IDA and analyse the binary.

<br>We can see some stack variables and nothing helping to understand the password.
<br>7. Continu analyzing the binary and find 4 <code>strcpy</code>.

<br>After the compares each brach loads into <code>var_10</code> index value.
<br>8. Each value of <code>var_10</code> lead into other branch. We need to decide in which branch to focus.

<br>9. We continue with the binary analysis and realize where to look closely.

<br> When <code>var_10</code> is equals 1 the program prints "Nice!".
<br>10. We now knows to focous on this flow -> to jump the program to this location. In order to do this we will use debugger: GDB.
<br>11. We load the executable with GDB: <code>gdb32.exe challenge.exe</code>
<br>12. Change the assembly language to Intel syntax: <code>set disassembly-flavor intel</code>
<br>13. Put break-point befor <code>var_10</code> is loaded into <code>EAX</code> register, as we saw from IDA, using the command: <code>break *0x0401A2B</code>
<br>14. Run the program with some password: <code>run admin123</code> and we will stop at the breakpoint.
<br>15. Examine <code>EIP</code> to make sure we reach the right location.

<br>16. Examine <code>EBP-0x10</code> to see the current value, which is: <code>-1</code>. We want to change this value to <code>1</code> to get the location where the program prints: "Nice!".
<img src="images/gdbCheckEBP.png" width="600">
<br> We also realize the location of <code>EBP-0x10</code> in memory which is: 0x60FEF8
<br>17. Set the value on the stack to 1 using the command: <code>set {int}0x60FEF8 = 1</code>.

<br>18. Continue the program and get the flag!
